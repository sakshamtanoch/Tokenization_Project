# Tokenization_Project

This is a tokenization project ( not production ready ), but still can be used to tokenize assets like gold,bonds etc by making small changes.
In here I used open zeppaline smart contracts and modified them to match my requirements.
Also you might find that I used solidity version 0.5.5, this is for the reason that open zeppaline stopped updating the crowdsale contract and hence I had to use the available resources.
